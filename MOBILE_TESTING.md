# Mobile Testing Guide for BRADYBALL

## Local Mobile Testing Setup

### Option 1: Using Your MacBook's Network (Recommended)

1. **Start the development server with network access:**
   ```bash
   npm run mobilestart
   ```

2. **Find your MacBook's IP address:**
   ```bash
   ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1
   ```
   Look for an IP like `192.168.x.x` or `10.x.x.x`

3. **On your mobile device:**
   - Connect to the same WiFi network as your MacBook
   - Open your browser and go to: `http://YOUR_MACBOOK_IP:4200`
   - Example: `http://192.168.1.100:4200`

### Option 2: Using Browser Developer Tools

1. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Open Chrome/Firefox Developer Tools:**
   - Press `F12` or `Cmd+Option+I`
   - Click the device toggle button (mobile/tablet icon)
   - Select a mobile device from the dropdown (iPhone, Android, etc.)

### Option 3: Using ngrok (For external testing)

1. **Install ngrok:**
   ```bash
   npm install -g ngrok
   ```

2. **Start your development server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **In another terminal, create a tunnel:**
   ```bash
   ngrok http 4200
   ```

4. **Use the ngrok URL on any device:**
   - Copy the `https://xxxxx.ngrok.io` URL
   - Share it with others for testing
